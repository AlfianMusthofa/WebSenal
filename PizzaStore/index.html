                <h3>The taste of Italy</h3>
                <button class="accordion">Wood Fired Ovens</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Traditional ovens, such as wood-fired ovens, have several advantages over modern ovens when it comes to making pizza. First, traditional ovens can reach much higher temperatures than modern ovens, which is essential for creating a crispy crust. Second, traditional ovens produce a more even heat, which helps to ensure that the pizza cooks evenly. Third, traditional ovens impart a unique flavor to the pizza that is not possible with modern ovens.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Flavors and aromas</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Traditional pizza is a simple dish, but it is full of flavor and aroma. The crust is made with simple ingredients, such as flour, water, salt, and yeast. It is then baked in a wood-fired oven until it is golden brown and crispy. The sauce is made with tomatoes, garlic, oregano, and basil. It is simple but flavorful, with a bright acidity and a herbaceous complexity.</p>
                </div>

                <button class="accordion">Certificated Made in Italy</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Pizza is a popular dish enjoyed by people all over the world. However, not all pizza is created equal. Certified made in Italy pizza is made with the highest quality ingredients and following traditional Italian methods. This ensures that you are getting a truly authentic and delicious pizza experience.</p>

                <button class="accordion">Sample Headline</button>
                <div class="panel">
                    <p>Sample Headline Pizza is a new type of pizza that is made with a unique dough that is designed to be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The dough is made with a blend of wheat flour, cornmeal, and semolina flour, which gives it a slightly nutty flavor. The pizza is topped with a variety of fresh ingredients, including tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and your choice of toppings.</p>
